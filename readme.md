**This project is a work in progress**.

This is the N-th attempt a simple Forth block based file system. See the Forth
file [ffs.fth][] for more information, including a to-do list and any
documentation. This project is very much a work in progress, it works under
<https://gforth.org/> and also SUBLEQ eForth (see <https://github.com/howerj/subleq>).
